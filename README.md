# Mobility Data Creator 

------
## Why Mobility Data? ü§î
Regardless of the means of transportation, 
individual human mobility is an aspect of our modern society with utmost relevance.
In order to maintain a mobility system without severe problems or to improve its efficiency and convenience, 
data-driven services based on mobility data of individual humans increasingly gain importance.
The availability of such data, however, is limited due to data privacy issues.
This concise tool helps to create synthetic mobility data in a realistic way 
that can then be used for all kinds of predictive tasks.  

-----------
## How Does It Work? üõ†Ô∏è
To run the `mobility-data-creator`, you may clone this repository and install the dependencies

- `pandas~=1.3.3`
- `numpy~=1.21.2`

as stated in the [requirements file](requirements.txt).
Then, you essentially need to provide

- a set of [known locations](data/known_locations.json), and
- the [travel times](data/travel_times.json) in between those,

in the [`data`](data) directory; 
for your convenience, exemplary default files are already provided. 
When running the [`main.py`](main.py) script, a [CSV-file](data/synthetic_trip_data.csv) 
is created containing a sequence of journeys, e.g. trips taken by car, ordered by time.
The columns represent the following information:

|Name    |Description|
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
|_gps_start_lat_|    Latitude of GPS position at start of trip|
|_gps_start_lon_|    Longitude of GPS position at start of trip|
|_t_start_|          Start time of trip as UTC time code in Milliseconds|
|_t_end_|            End time of trip as UTC time code in Milliseconds|
|_gps_end_lat_|      Latitude of GPS position at end of trip|
|_gps_end_lon_|      Longitude of GPS position at end of trip|

For the already provided example data, the created raw data points are visualized here:

In addition, the logic of how the sequence of journeys is extended can be 
adapted in [`trip_creation.py`](trip_creation.py).

## For What Can It Be Useful? üÖøÔ∏è‚è≤Ô∏èüöó
The [data set](data/synthetic_trip_data.csv) presented here was used for a study on 
estimating the parking duration of vehicles (_COMING SOON:_ Link to scientific paper [^1]). <!-- (TODO: add link to paper here!) -->
Beyond this, however, a variety of further use cases, e.g. predicting the next place to visit, is conceivable.
